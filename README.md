# Rocket-Elevators-Golang-Controller
This is the golang commercial controller program.

### This controller is capable of supporting two main events:

1. A person presses a call button on a floor to request an elevator. The controller selects an available cage and it is routed to that person based on two parameters provided by pressing the button:
- The floor where the person is
- The direction in which he will go (up or down)
2. A person at the Lobby requests a floor and is sent to the correct column. The parameters provided are :
- The floor where the user want to go
- The direction in which he will go (up or down)

In the scenarios provided, we use a building of 66 floors including 6 basements served by 4 columns of 5 cages each. The floors are separated amongst the columns in the following way: B6 to B1, 2 to 20, 21 to 40, 41 to 60. All the columns serve the 1st floor (Lobby). There are no floor buttons inside the elevators. Instead, there is a panel at the Lobby with which the users select where they want to go.

### Example of scenario

Scenario 1:
- Elevator B1 at 20th floor going to the 5th floor
- Elevator B2 at 3rd floor going to the 15th floor
- Elevator B3 at 13th floor going to Lobby
- Elevator B4 at 15th floor going to the 2nd floor
- Elevator B5 at 6th floor going to Lobby

Someone at Lobby wants to go to the 20th floor.
Elevator B5 is expected to be sent.
